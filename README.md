# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch with your name as your branch name. For example, mine would be `Mylynh-Nguyen`.
3. Create a new axios request function with the swapi.dev api, here: https://swapi.dev/. Use Async await from my example. I want something other than /people.
4. Once you're done, create a pull request, with your forked repository as your base branch. Make appropriate comments.
5. Invite me as a reviewer. I will check your work accordingly.
